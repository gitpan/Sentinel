NAME
    `Sentinel' - create lightweight SCALARs with get/set callbacks

SYNOPSIS
     package Some::Class;

     use Sentinel;

     sub foo :lvalue
     {
        my $self = shift;
        sentinel get => sub { return $self->get_foo },
                 set => sub { $self->set_foo( $_[0] ) };
     }

     sub bar :lvalue
     {
        my $self = shift;
        sentinel value => $self->get_bar,
                 set   => sub { $self->set_bar( $_[0] ) };
     }

     sub splot :lvalue
     {
        sentinel obj => shift, get => \&get_splot, set => \&set_splot;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a single lvalue function, `sentinel', which yields
    a scalar that invoke callbacks to get or set its value. Primarily this
    is useful to create lvalue object accessors or other functions, to
    invoke actual code when a new value is set, rather than simply updating
    a scalar variable.

FUNCTIONS
  $scalar = sentinel %args
    Returns (as an lvalue) a scalar with magic attached to it. This magic is
    used to get the value of the scalar, or to inform of a new value being
    set, by invoking callback functions supplied to the sentinel. Takes the
    following named arguments:

    get => CODE
            A `CODE' reference to invoke when the value of the scalar is
            read, to obtain its value. The value returned from this code
            will appear as the value of the scalar.

    set => CODE
            A `CODE' reference to invoke when a new value for the scalar is
            written. The code will be passed the new value as its only
            argument.

    value => SCALAR
            If no `get' callback is provided, this value is given as the
            initial value of the scalar. If the scalar manages to survive
            longer than a single assignment, its value on read will retain
            the last value set to it.

    obj => SCALAR
            Optional value to pass as the first argument into the `get' and
            `set' callbacks. If this value is provided, then the `get' and
            `set' callbacks may be given as direct sub references to object
            methods, rather than closures that capture the referent object.
            This avoids the runtime overhead of creating lots of small
            one-use closures around the object.

XS vs PUREPERL
    If an XS compiler is available at build time, this module is implemented
    using XS. If not, it falls back on an implementation using a `tie'd
    scalar. A pureperl installation can also be requested at build time by
    passing the `--pp' argument to Build.PL:

     $ perl Build.PL --pp
     $ ./Build

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    With thanks to `leont', `Zefram', and others from `irc.perl.org/#p5p'
    for assisting with trickier bits of XS logic. Thanks to `mst' for
    suggesting a pureperl implementation for XS-challenged systems.
